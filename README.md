The File SignNameListener is in development. 
Please ignore it.
The MySQL code was not built by myself.
The library "ProtocolLib" is not used, however it will be used soon. Use "gradle build" to build the code. The output jar will be located in a newly generated folder (in the project directory) called "server/plugins".


Commands:

- Me: /me <player (optional)>
- Group: /group <add, remove, create, delete, edit>
- Permissions: /permissions <add, remove>
